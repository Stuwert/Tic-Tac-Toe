        <h3>How To Play the Game</h3>
        <p>
          This is your basic game of Tic Tac Toe.  The notification of the screen lets you know which player's turn it is.
        </p>
        <p>
          The objective is to make a line of your pieces (either X or Y), such that there are three of them in a row.
        </p>
        <p>
          This may be done diagonally, in rows, or in columns.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of each game, you may choose to restart.
